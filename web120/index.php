       <p>Hello, my name is Christian Patton. I love animals! I have cats, dogs, birds, and even a pet dwarf goat! My goats name is goatee :) she loves to get buzzed eating marijuana trimmings ;)</p>
       <p>I am taking this WEB120 class as part of my path to completing my Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in Web Design. Computers have always been a big part of my life, I love them!</p>
       <p>Outside of the computer realm, one of my biggest dreams since I was a little kid was to become a professional wrestler! I'm a huge fan of the WWE and love going to live shows in Seattle</p>
