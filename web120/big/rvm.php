        <h2>Responsive Vs. Mobile</h2>
       <p>What are the key differences between “responsive” websites and “mobile” applications? </p>
       
        <p><i>“Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).” </i> (W3Schools)  </p>
       
        <p>Responsive websites are generally less time-consuming and more affordable than building a mobile application. </p>
       
        <p>“Mobile apps, on the other hand, are specific applications customized to each Operating System (OS) that feature unique designs and codebases.” (Smashstack)
 </p>
       
        <p>Mobile applications help to create brand awareness. Load times are generally quicker than responsive web, featuring greater functionality on mobile devices.  
 
</p>
        
        <p><b>So, should you care more about responsive web or mobile apps? is one better than the other? 
</b></p>
        
        <p>Both responsive websites and mobile applications have their pros and cons. The question of which is better can’t be answered so simply, as it ultimately comes down to your own needs. Not all businesses need a mobile app to thrive. If you want to save costs, or avoid the headache of managing your own mobile application, a website can be designed easily and more affordably to feature as many mobile benefits as possible. Or is your business popular with customers of a younger demographic? Does it receive a heavy amount of mobile traffic? If there are similar businesses competing with you, do they have a mobile app of their own? If the answer to these questions is yes, chances are considering a mobile application would be a smart move for the longevity of your business.
